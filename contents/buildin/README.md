# buildin commands



You can use `compgen -b` from a bash shell to get a list of the shell's builtin commands ([bash - How do I list all available shell builtin commands? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/512918/how-do-i-list-all-available-shell-builtin-commands)) 

Note that the command `compgen` is a bash built-in but is not described under the build-in section of Bash-manual, it is filed under the [Programmable Completion Builtins section](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Programmable-Completion-Builtins.html).

Why buildin exit?  [command line - Why is there a /bin/echo and why would I want to use it? - Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/960822/why-is-there-a-bin-echo-and-why-would-i-want-to-use-it/960886#960886)
