# Bash system variable



This chapter describes the shell variables that Bash uses. Bash automatically assigns default values to a number of variables.

I am calling this kind of variable **system** variable because they hold values that describe Bash shell's behaviour. However, it seem like some people call them **environmental** variable. Bash manual call them **shell variables**.
