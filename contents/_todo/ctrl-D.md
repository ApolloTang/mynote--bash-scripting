### Ctrl + D 



Ref:  [Using Ctrl + D in Linux and Bash | Programmer Hat](https://www.programmerhat.com/linux-ctrl-d/) 



Ctrl + D works only when your terminal is reading inputs

Behaviour:

1. After typing in a command in the terminal, press **Ctrl + D** will execute the command the same way **Enter** would do
2. Pressing `Ctrl + D` in a terminal prompt will close the terminal.

Ctrl + D tells the terminal that user has finished typining command so that it can go ahead to  execute the command. If user did not enter a any command, the terminal see an empty value which translated as a zero value. A zero value tell the terminal to quite.
