# Expansions 

[Bash Reference Manual #Shell-Expansions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Expansions.html) 

There are seven kinds of expansion performed (listed in the order of expansions):

1. brace expansion
2. tilde expansion
3. parameter and variable expansion [[§link-to-sec](./parameter-n-variable-expansion/README.md)]
4. arithmetic expansion
5. command substitution 
6. word splitting (also called field splitting) [[§link-to-sec](./word-splitting/README.md)]
7. filename expansion

In addition to the above, some systems also have process substitution [[§link-to-sec](./process-substitution/README.md)].
