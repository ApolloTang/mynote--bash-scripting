# Brace expansion

Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions, and any characters special to other expansions are preserved in the result. (see [illustrated example](./ipynb--brance-expansion-and-file-expansion/index.ipynb))


A dollars-sign symbol before opening brace `${` will inhibit brace expansion because `${` is the syntax for parameter expansion.
