# Bash system variables

This chapter describes the shell variables that Bash uses. 

Bash automatically assigns default values to some variables. I call these variables the **system** variables because they hold values that describe the Bash shell's behaviour. However, some people call them **environmental** variables, and the Bash manual calls them **shell variables**.
