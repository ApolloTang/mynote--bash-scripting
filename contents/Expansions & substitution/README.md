There are seven kinds of expansion performed (listed in the order of expansions):

1. brace expansion
2. tilde expansion
3. parameter and variable expansion
4. arithmetic expansion
5. command substitution
6. [word splitting](./word-splitting/README.md)
7. filename expansion

In addition to the above, some systems also have process substitution.
